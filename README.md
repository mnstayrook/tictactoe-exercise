# Title: Tic Tac Toe Exercise
 
_Created by Maegan Stayrook_

Description:
In her MERN Full Stack Development course, Maegan was tasked with creating a Tic Tac Toe game.

How to Run:
Have two players (or battle against yourself). Click squares per turn until someone wins.

Roadmap:
As time goes on, she plans to revisit or simply recreate it to implement more features, such as:
- A 'replay' button when someone wins.
- Update the color of the entire platform to make it more appealing.
- Make it so that it reads "Player 1" and "Player 2" instead of "Player X" and "Player O".
